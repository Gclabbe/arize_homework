[2023] Arize PM Take Home Assignment

Arize is an observability platform for ML and LLM applications.

For this role, we’re looking for 

a technical PM with hands on keyboard experience to partner with our engineering team. The space is highly technical  
(both our customers and challenges), which makes this skill set a requirement at our stage.

ML/DS background. Our customers are data scientists, ML engineers and LLM engineers. For us to understand their pain,  
we need to feel this pain ourselves deeply

Product vision. This person will be driving the future of the product - developing intuition on where the pain points  
are today and where to invest will be critical to the success of the PM.


As part of this interview process, we’d love to learn more about your technical and product abilities for us to gauge  
whether there is a fit. Instructions for the take home are:
* Try out Langchain or Llamindex for a personal project. You create this application in a notebook or hosted environment.
* Some example use cases are here (langchain)[https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/extraction] but feel free to get creative here
* Try out Arize/Phoenix for your project and share any feedback on your product experience.

How was your onboarding? What went well, what didn’t go well?  

What metrics would you measure for new users?  

Based on your experience and the evolving LLM landscape, come back with ideas on what you would invest in if you were  
the PM of this team.

Please send over artifacts for 1, 2 and 3 to aparna@arize.com and aman@arize.com.
